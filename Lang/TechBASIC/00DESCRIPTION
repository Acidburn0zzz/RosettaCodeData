<h1>Write Scientific and Educational Programs on the iPhone/iPad</h1>

== '''Overview''' ==

techBASIC has been around since 2011 and is a comprehensive software development and technical computing environment for programming, data collection, displaying sophisticated interactive graphics and analyzing data. 

techBASIC is a powerful matrix-rich version of the famously easy to use BASIC programming language. Their built-in help system, reference manual and web-based tutorials make it easy to start using techBASIC for real problems in programming, education and in the professional lab right away.

And once you finish your app in techBASIC, compile it with techBASIC App Builder and XCode on your Macintosh to create a stand-alone app. You can share that app with others using Ad Hoc distribution or publish it on Apple’s App Store.


== '''Building iPhone & iPad Electronic Projects''' ==

Buy ready-built or DIY electronic kits, design, invent your own sensors, data collectors, a comprehensive scientific development environment right on your mobile device. Connect to internal and external sensors using techBASIC’s built-in commands.

techBASIC brings the power of a desktop computer to your iPhone/iPad for programming, collecting and analyzing data, and visualizing and manipulating stunning 3D graphics. It’s a robust implementation of the  famously easy to use BASIC Programming Language with specialized array and matrix commands. 

Scientists and engineers can collect and analyze complex data easily and accurately with techBASIC. The built-in floating-point libraries insure calculations are precise. Special classes make it easy to perform complex array and matrix calculations. The graphing capabilities allow you to display and interact with your data in new and amazing ways. And, data can be moved easily to and from your desktop computer.

A new book from O’Reilly features techBASIC, showing how to access real-world Arduino, sensor and Bluetooth Low Energy apps in techBASIC. The book is available in print and ebook format.
