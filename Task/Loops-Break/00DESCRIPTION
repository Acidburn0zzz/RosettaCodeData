;Task:
Show a loop which prints random numbers (each number newly generated each loop) from &nbsp; '''0''' &nbsp; to &nbsp; '''19''' &nbsp; (inclusive).

If a number is &nbsp; '''0''' &nbsp; stop the loop after printing it, and do not generate any further numbers.

Otherwise, generate and print a second random number before restarting the loop.

If the number &nbsp; '''0''' &nbsp; is never generated as the first number in a loop, loop forever.
